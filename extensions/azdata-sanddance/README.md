By using easy-to-understand views, SandDance helps you find insights about your data, which in turn help you tell stories supported by data, build cases based on evidence, test hypotheses, dig deeper into surface explanations, support decisions for purchases, or relate data into a wider, real world context.

SandDance uses unit visualizations, which apply a one-to-one mapping between rows in your database and marks on the screen.
Smooth animated transitions between views help you to maintain context as you interact with your data.

## Usage

There are multiple ways to invoke a visualization:
* Right-click on a .csv or .tsv file and choose *View in SandDance*.
* In SQL query results pane, click the Visualizer icon.
